## Object-oriented programming

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that is based on the concept of “objects”, which are instances of classes. OOP is a way of organizing and structuring code that is based on the principles of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

Encapsulation refers to the idea that an object’s internal state should be hidden and accessible only through its methods. This allows the object to control how its data is used and prevents external code from making invalid changes to the object’s state.
